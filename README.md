Here is my first full stack webapp utilising Python, Django, React, JavsScript and more.
I converted the tutorial React code to use Functional Components instead of Class Components
It is based on this tutorial (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react#step-1-setting-up-the-backend).
